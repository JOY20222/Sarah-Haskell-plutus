 🌍 Cardano University Onboarding Project – Project Catalyst

**Author**:Sarah Lekhooana  
**Affiliation**: Student, Tobb Technologies

---

 📌 A. Introduction

We are currently running a project approved under **Project Catalyst** to onboard **16 universities globally**. This is a unique opportunity for your college to be a pioneer and take part in an impactful Web3 development program.

**Cardano** is home to Project Catalyst—the world’s largest decentralized innovation engine—designed to solve real-world challenges through community-driven projects.

---

 🎯 B. Aim

To grow the **Cardano developer ecosystem** and upskill **university and college students** in **Web3 Cardano Smart Contract** development.

---

 ✅ C. Objectives

- Students create blockchain assets: **Fungible Tokens (FTs)**, **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**.
- Students create **on-chain Smart Contracts using Haskell Plutus**.
- Gain foundational knowledge of Cardano tech: **CIP-1694**, **Midnight**, **Midgard (Hydra)**.
- Upskill in **problem-solving** and **functional programming**.
- Collaborate via the **Intersect MBO Developer Advocate Program**.
- Contribute to **Cardano Open Source Intersect GitHub**:
  - Forks
  - Pull Requests
  - Commits
  - Developer Experience
- Promote Cardano community products & services funded by community voting:
  - **Cardano Foundation**, **IOG**, **Intersect**
  - **Stake pool operators**
  - **Emurgo**
  - **Gimbalabs**
  - Global Cardano communities
