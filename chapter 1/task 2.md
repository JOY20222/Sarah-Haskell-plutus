HC1T2 - Task 2: Pure Function Example

---

### âœ… Full Running Haskell Code (Pure Function with `Maybe`)

```haskell
-- File: CircleArea.hs

-- A pure function that calculates the area of a circle safely
circleArea :: (Ord a, Floating a) => a -> Maybe a
circleArea r
    | r < 0     = Nothing
    | otherwise = Just (pi * r * r)

-- Main function to demonstrate usage
main :: IO ()
main = do
    let radius = 5.0
    case circleArea radius of
        Just area -> putStrLn $ "Area of circle with radius " ++ show radius ++ " is " ++ show area
        Nothing   -> putStrLn "Error: Radius cannot be negative."
```

---

### ðŸ”§ How to Run the Code:

1. Save the code in a file named `CircleArea.hs`.
2. Compile and run it using GHC:

```bash
ghc CircleArea.hs -o circleArea
./circleArea
```

Or, run it in GHCi (interactive mode):

```bash
ghci CircleArea.hs
*Main> main
Area of circle with radius 5.0 is 78.53981633974483
```

---

### âœ… Why This Is a Pure Function:

* `circleArea` is a pure function: it has no side effects.
* It returns the same result for the same input.
* It does not read/write any external state.
* It uses `Maybe` for safe error handling instead of crashing.
