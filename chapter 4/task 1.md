```haskell
-- Define weatherReport using pattern matching
weatherReport :: String -> String
weatherReport "sunny"  = "It's a bright and beautiful day!"
weatherReport "rainy"  = "Don't forget your umbrella!"
weatherReport "cloudy" = "A bit gloomy, but no rain yet!"
weatherReport _        = "Weather unknown"

-- Main function to test weatherReport
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("weatherReport \"sunny\" = " ++ weatherReport "sunny")
    putStrLn ("weatherReport \"rainy\" = " ++ weatherReport "rainy")
    putStrLn ("weatherReport \"cloudy\" = " ++ weatherReport "cloudy")
    putStrLn ("weatherReport \"windy\" = " ++ weatherReport "windy")
```
