```haskell
-- Define the grade function using guards
grade :: Int -> String
grade score
    | score >= 90 = "A"
    | score >= 80 = "B"
    | score >= 70 = "C"
    | score >= 60 = "D"
    | otherwise   = "F"

-- Main function to test the grade function
main :: IO ()
main = do
    putStrLn ("grade 95 = " ++ grade 95)
    putStrLn ("grade 72 = " ++ grade 72)
    putStrLn ("grade 50 = " ++ grade 50)
```

### ðŸ”§ How to Run:
